Imagery is a slack bot that takes any uploaded image, hosts it on Imgur and posts the link to the same channel after deleting the uploaded image, thus, saving space on a free plan.

## GIF Demo

## Setup

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Deploy this app on heroku and install the app on slack. Create account on Imgur and get a `Client-ID`
Add `slack_access_token` and `client_id` to the environment variables in Heroku config.

## Updates

Imagery now sends a private message that asks if the image is to be uploaded to Imgur. (In case it's an private image)

## TODO
- [ ] Add support for other file types (?)
